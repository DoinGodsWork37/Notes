This is a repo for some of the most useful statistics notes, textbooks, courses, and resources that I used when learining statistics for data science.

- MIT 18.6501x --> great resources for learning about statistics. This comes in a Coursera course (https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+18.6501x+3T2018/courseware/unit1/u1s1_whatisstats/?child=first) as well as on MIT's website (https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-650-statistics-for-applications-fall-2016/syllabus/). The professor, Professor Philippe Rigollet, has really energetic and informative lectures. Definitely would recommend this class to anyone looking to begin learning about stats.
