#Q1. Sort
# Attach(mtcars)
#Sort dataframe by mpg (ascending) and cyl (descending)
mtcars
attach(mtcars)

df1 <- mtcars[order(mtcars$mpg,-mtcars$cyl),]
df1 


#Q2. Subset
# Attach(mtcars)
#Select cars  whose horsepower (hp) is greater than Chrysler Imperial  and sort the new dataframe by mpg.
#note: we could also have used the subset function here, but I just wanted to try different methods we hadn't seen in class
#i also put how we can do it in subset at the end of this first method,
#eg. Chrysler_hp <- subset(cars, rownames(mtcars) == "Chrysler Imperial")$hp, and so on
#i wanted to use dplyr because in the first class we had discussed how many people today are looking for that skill
?select.list
?dplyr

mtcars_df <- data.frame(mtcars)

#view row and column names
rownames(mtcars)
dimnames(mtcars)

mtcars_rownames <- c(rownames(mtcars))
mtcars_rownames

#add car names
#rownames(mtcars_df)[0] <- "Car"
mtcars_w_names <- data.frame(mtcars_rownames, mtcars_df)
mtcars_w_names

#converting data to tbl class
table_mtcars <- tbl_df(mtcars_w_names)
table_mtcars

chrysler_info <-table_mtcars %>% filter(mtcars_rownames == "Chrysler Imperial")
chrysler_info
#we can now see that hp = 230 

#find cars w hp higher than chrysler
cars_w_higher_hp <- table_mtcars %>% filter(hp >230)
cars_w_higher_hp
class(cars_w_higher_hp)

#sort new df by mpg
index_mpg <- order(cars_w_higher_hp$mpg, decreasing = TRUE)
index_mpg

mpg_descending <- cars_w_higher_hp[index_mpg,]
mpg_descending

####if we want to use the subset method, we can also do the following: 
?subset
chrysler_hp_subset <- subset(mtcars_df, rownames(mtcars_df) == "Chrysler Imperial")$hp
chrysler_hp_subset

cars_w_higher_hp_subset <- subset(mtcars_df, hp > chrysler_hp_subset)
cars_w_higher_hp_subset

#this is ordered by mpg ascending vs earlier's descending order
cars_w_higher_hp_subset[order(cars_w_higher_hp_subset$mpg),]

#note, not suer why they are printing in triangles, or if that's simply because fib is a vector and thus priting it out this way is just a function of the sequence

#Q5. While Loop
#You bought a house at price of $700K. 
#If the interest to real estate market in the area increases and the estimated price of 
#house goes above 750K, you may want to sell it. 
#Otherwise, you will keep it. You will generate a random price 
#between 600K and 800K for each quarter as a proxy for the interest to your house 
#(The price can fluctuate between -100K to +100K around 700K after each quarter). 

#Design a while loop and show how many quarters (loops) will it take to sell the house. 
#Hint: There is no specific value for the answer since 
#we generate random values with sample(x, size, replace = FALSE, prob = NULL) in each loop.
